You are given two integers, x and y, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: (x, y). You are also given an array points where each points[i] = [ai, bi] represents that a point exists at (ai, bi). A point is valid if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.
